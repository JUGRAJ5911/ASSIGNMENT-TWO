                <span class="verse1">I walked across an empty land</span><br>
                <span class="verse1">I knew the pathway like the back of my hand</span><br>
                <span class="verse1">I felt the earth beneath my feet</span><br>
                <span class="verse1">Sat by the river and it made me complete</span><br><br>

                <span class="refrain">Oh, simple thing, where have you gone?</span><br>
                <span class="refrain">I'm getting old and I need something to rely on</span><br>
                <span class="refrain">So tell me when you're gonna let me in</span><br>
                <span class="refrain">I'm getting tired and I need somewhere to begin</span><br><br>

                <span class="verse2">I came across a fallen tree</span><br>
                <span class="verse2">I felt the branches of it looking at me</span><br>
                <span class="verse2">Is this the place we used to love?</span><br>
                <span class="verse2">Is this the place that I've been dreaming of?</span><br><br>

                <span class="refrain">Oh, simple thing, where have you gone?</span><br>
                <span class="refrain">I'm getting old and I need something to rely on</span><br>
                <span class="refrain">So tell me when you're gonna let me in</span><br>
                <span class="refrain">I'm getting tired and I need somewhere to begin</span><br><br>

                <span class="chorus">And if you have a minute, why don't we go</span><br>
                <span class="chorus">Talk about it somewhere only we know?</span><br>
                <span class="chorus">This could be the end of everything</span><br>
                <span class="chorus">So why don't we go somewhere only we know?</span><br><br>
